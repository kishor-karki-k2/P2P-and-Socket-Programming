# P2P-and-Socket-Programming
In this project, we study techniques for developing a peer-to-
peer chat system and analyze the challenges involved. While
most chat applications rely on a central server, our project
takes a different approach by creating a simple peer-to-peer
(P2P) chat application using TCP sockets, allowing users to
communicate directly. This method not only demonstrates the
benefits of decentralized networking but also deepens our un-
derstanding of direct computer-to-computer interaction. In this
paper, we outline our motivation, architecture, implementation
details, testing methods, and potential future improvements.
